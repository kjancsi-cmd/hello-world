# hello-world
this is my first repository
A repository is usually used to organize a single project.
Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spredsheets, and data sets - anything your project needs.
We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.



The saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is an explanation why is the change has been made. Those messages capture the history of the changes, so other contributors can understand what you have done and why.
